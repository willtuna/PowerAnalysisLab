    """High level class for controlling captures.

    An acquisition controller coordinates all of the smaller pieces to allow
    power traces to be recorded. The sequence in a typical capture is:
    - Key and input text are calculated using a key-text pattern
    - Scope is armed
    - Target is sent key and input text
    - Output text is recorded from target
    - Power trace is read from scope
    - Input and output data are saved into project

    Also, an acquisition controller tracks a number of auxiliary functions
    which can perform any other tasks during a capture, such as resetting
